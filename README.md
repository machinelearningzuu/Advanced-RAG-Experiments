# Advanced-RAG-Experiments

Explore the cutting-edge world of advanced retriever and generator (RAG) models through the "Advanced-RAG-Experiments" repository. This collection of Jupyter notebooks and experiments is designed to provide a deep dive into the capabilities and nuances of advanced RAG models in the field of natural language processing.

## What's Inside?

- **Experiments:** Engage in hands-on experiments that push the boundaries of retriever and generator architectures. Explore novel approaches to information retrieval, document selection, and context-aware text generation.

- **Comparisons:** Evaluate and compare different RAG variants, fine-tuning strategies, and pre-training techniques to understand their impact on performance and versatility.

- **Use Cases:** Discover practical use cases where advanced RAG models excel, from general question-answering systems to E2E automation systems and beyond.

## How to Use?

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/machinelearningzuu/Advanced-RAG-Experiments.git
   cd Advanced-RAG-Experiments
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore Experiments:**
   Open the Jupyter notebooks using your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, etc.) and start experimenting with advanced RAG models.
